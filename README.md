A simple word game...

+================================================================+
| Welcome to the word game!                                      |
|                                                                |
| This is a 2-player word game, in which the players take        |
| turns saying a letter. If a player says a letter that ends     |
| a word, that player loses. Similarly, if a player says a       |
| letter from which no word can be spelled, that player loses.   |
|                                                                |
| For example: if the letters so far are "COR", then the next    |
| player could not say "E" (spelling "CORE") or "Z" ("CORZ"      |
| is not the beginning to any words) without losing.             |
|                                                                |
